2. Add the `your-project/backups-config.json` to project which folder you want to back up. Example:

```json

  "type": "local-storage",
  "copies": {
    "daily": 4,
    "weekly": 3,
    "monthly": 2,
    "annually": 2
  }
}
```

More examples you can find in `config-examples` folder

3. Create `projects/super-easy-file-backups` folder and `docker-compose.yml` inside it.

```yml 
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3'
services:
  super-easy-file-backups:
    image: 'ghcr.io/codelit/super-easy-file-backups'
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - C:/Users/Adam/projects/your-project:/app/projects/your-project # from
      - C:/Users/Adam/backups/your-project:/app/backups/your-project # to
      # OR seek for backups-config.json in entire projects folder
      - C:/Users/Adam/projects:/app/projects
      - C:/Users/Adam/backups:/app/backups
```

You can find more examples in `docker-compose.override-example.yml`.

4. Run this command inside `super-easy-file-backups` folder
```shell
docker-compose up
```

5. ✅ Check out the result

## 🛠️ Advanced configuration

You can also exclude files and folders from backup. Use **filter** option
with [patterns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maximatch).

Example of backups-config.json:

```json
{
   "type": "local-storage",
   "copies": {
     "daily": 2,
     "weekly": 1,
     "monthly": 1,
     "annually": 1
   },
   "filter": [
      "node_modules/**",
      "**/*.log",
      "data/folder/*",
      "package.lock",
     "**/*_file-ending.*"
   ],
  "compression_level": "default"
}
```

### 🔧 `type` option:

Type of backup, local or cloud

### 🔧 `copies` option:

How many copies need to be in according folders, file tree will look like this:
<pre>
📦backups
 ┣ 📂annually
 ┃ ┗ 📜bkp_2023-09-06.tgz
 ┣ 📂daily
 ┃ ┣ 📜bkp_2023-09-06.tgz
 ┃ ┗ 📜bkp_2023-09-10.tgz
 ┣ 📂monthly
 ┃ ┗ 📜bkp_2023-09-06.tgz
 ┗ 📂weekly
 ┃ ┗ 📜bkp_2023-09-06.tgz
</pre>

### 🔧 `filter` option:

- Exclude files inside **node_modules** folder recursively
- Exclude all **.log** files recursively
- Exclude all inside **data/folder** not-recursively
- Exclude **package.lock**
- Exclude files recursively by ending **_fileending**

### 🔧 `compression_level` option:

- `default`: default compression, compromise between speed and compression
- `fast`: fastest compression
- `best`: best and slowest compression
- `none`: no compression
